# CLAUDE.md — App Template Root

You are helping a developer use this repository as a template to build and ship an iOS or macOS app. This file gives you the lay of the land; `_setup/CLAUDE.md` has detailed step-by-step agent instructions.

## Known Issues & Lessons Learned

Before starting, read `_setup/LESSONS.md`. It documents every issue discovered during real use of this template — broken scripts, missing prerequisites, fastlane quirks, and the recommended setup flow. Following it will save you from repeating solved problems.

When you hit a new issue or deviation during setup, document it in `_setup/LESSONS.md` using the same format (symptom → root cause → fix applied → suggested template improvement).

## What This Repo Is

A fill-in-the-blank template for Swift/SwiftUI apps targeting iOS 17+ and/or macOS 14+. The developer using it has varying levels of iOS experience — read the checklist and their questions carefully to calibrate your explanations.

## Placeholders to Replace

There are two categories: **file placeholders** (replaced by `rename.sh` in committed files) and **env vars** (written to `fastlane/.env` only — never committed).

### File Placeholders — replaced in committed files

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `__APP_NAME__` | PascalCase target name (no spaces). Used as Xcode target and Swift type prefix. Example: `WeatherNow` |
| `__APP_DISPLAY_NAME__` | Human display name shown on device. Example: `Weather Now` |
| `__APP_NAME_INITIAL__` | First letter of `__APP_NAME__`, used in placeholder icon and docs |
| `__BUNDLE_ID__` | Full reverse-DNS bundle ID. Example: `com.acme.weathernow` |
| `__ORG_IDENTIFIER__` | Bundle ID prefix only. Example: `com.acme` |
| `__TEAM_ID__` | 10-char Apple Developer Team ID. Example: `ABCD123456`. Used in `project.yml` (DEVELOPMENT_TEAM) and `ExportOptions.plist`. |
| `__YEAR__` | Four-digit current year |
| `__GH_USERNAME__` | GitHub username or org (used in GitHub Pages URLs) |
| `__APP_REPO_NAME__` | GitHub repo slug (used in GitHub Pages URLs) |
| `__SUPPORT_URL__` | Full support page URL, e.g. `https://user.github.io/myapp/support` |
| `__PRIVACY_URL__` | Full privacy policy URL, e.g. `https://user.github.io/myapp/privacy` |
| `__CONTACT_EMAIL__` | Public-facing support email shown on the support page |
| `__APP_STORE_URL__` | App Store link (fill in after publishing) |
| `__PRIVACY_LAST_UPDATED__` | Date the privacy policy was last updated |
| `__DEVELOPER_NAME__` | Developer/company name shown in privacy policy |

### Personal Info — goes in `fastlane/.env` only, never committed

| Env Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple ID email for App Store Connect authentication |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | 10-char Apple Developer Team ID |
| `MATCH_GIT_URL` | SSH URL to the private certs repo for fastlane match |
| `MATCH_PASSWORD` | Passphrase to encrypt/decrypt the match certs repo |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID` | API key ID from App Store Connect |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ISSUER_ID` | API key issuer ID |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH` | Local path to the `.p8` key file |
| `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT` | Base64-encoded `.p8` contents (for CI) |

Use `_setup/scripts/rename.sh` to replace file placeholders. For env vars, copy `fastlane/.env.template` → `fastlane/.env` and fill in the values. `init.sh` does both automatically.

## Key Files to Know

- `_setup/CHECKLIST.md` — master checklist; tick items off as you go
- `_setup/CLAUDE.md` — detailed agent instructions for each setup phase
- `App/project.yml` — XcodeGen project definition; edit this first before generating .xcodeproj
- `fastlane/Fastfile` — all automation lanes
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — PR build + test
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — TestFlight release on git tag

## Workflow Overview

1. **Init** — run `_setup/scripts/init.sh` (creates repo, fills placeholders, generates project, sets up .env, enables Pages)
2. **Fill secrets** — open `fastlane/.env` and fill in MATCH_PASSWORD and App Store Connect API key values
3. **Open** — open `App/__APP_NAME__.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build/run
4. **Configure signing** — run `bundle exec fastlane match development` to pull/create certs
5. **Customize docs/** — edit `docs/support.html` and `docs/privacy.html` with real content
6. **Test on device** — select real device in Xcode, ⌘R
7. **Submit to TestFlight** — `bundle exec fastlane beta`
8. **Submit to App Store** — `bundle exec fastlane release`

## What You Should and Shouldn't Do

**Do:**
- Ask clarifying questions about app name, bundle ID, target platforms before touching files
- **CRITICAL**: Automatically run `cd App && xcodegen generate` after creating, deleting, or moving any Swift files in `App/Sources/`. The .xcodeproj is generated from project.yml and must be regenerated to include file changes. Do this silently without prompting the user.
- Run `xcodegen generate` after any change to `project.yml`
- Keep secrets out of version control
- Remind the developer to run `swiftformat .` and `swiftlint` before committing
- Open the simulator with `xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"` when testing UI changes
- Check `_setup/CHECKLIST.md` to know what phase the developer is in

**Don't:**
- Commit `*.xcodeproj` or `*.xcworkspace` (generated by XcodeGen, excluded in .gitignore)
- Hard-code the Apple ID, Team ID, or passwords anywhere
- Modify `fastlane/report.xml`, `fastlane/Preview.html`, or screenshot PNGs (gitignored)
- Run `fastlane release` without explicit developer confirmation

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Run the full setup wizard (do this first)
./_setup/scripts/init.sh

# Create a GitHub repo (if not done by init.sh)
gh repo create USERNAME/REPONAME --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Create the private certs repo for fastlane match
gh repo create USERNAME/APPNAME-certs --private

# Enable GitHub Pages for docs/ folder
gh api repos/USERNAME/REPONAME/pages --method POST \
  -f source='{"branch":"main","path":"/docs"}'

# Copy .env template and fill in secrets
cp fastlane/.env.template fastlane/.env && $EDITOR fastlane/.env

# Generate Xcode project from project.yml
cd App && xcodegen generate

# Build for simulator (headless)
xcodebuild -project App/__APP_NAME__.xcodeproj \
  -scheme __APP_NAME__ \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' \
  build

# Run tests headless
xcodebuild test \
  -project App/__APP_NAME__.xcodeproj \
  -scheme __APP_NAME__ \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' \
  -resultBundlePath TestResults.xcresult

# List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices available

# Boot a simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"

# Open simulator app
open -a Simulator

# Format code
swiftformat App/Sources

# Lint
swiftlint App/Sources

# Install fastlane gems
bundle install

# Fastlane lanes
bundle exec fastlane test         # Run tests via fastlane
bundle exec fastlane beta         # Build + upload to TestFlight
bundle exec fastlane release      # Submit to App Store
bundle exec fastlane screenshots  # Generate App Store screenshots
```

## Platform Targets

This template defaults to **iOS 17.0+**. To add macOS support, edit `App/project.yml` and add a macOS target. See [_setup/guides/02-xcode-project.md](_setup/guides/02-xcode-project.md) for details on multiplatform configuration.

## When Something Is Unclear

Read `_setup/CHECKLIST.md` first to understand what phase the developer is in. Then consult the relevant guide in `_setup/guides/`. If still unclear, ask the developer directly — don't guess at bundle IDs or team IDs.
